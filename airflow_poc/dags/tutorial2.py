# Files can also be passed to the bash_command argument, like bash_command='templated_command.sh', where the file location is relative to the directory containing the pipeline file (tutorial.py in this case). This may be desirable for many reasons, like separating your script’s logic and pipeline code, allowing for proper code highlighting in files composed in different languages, and general flexibility in structuring pipelines. It is also possible to define your template_searchpath as pointing to any folder locations in the DAG constructor call.

# # The bit shift operator can also be
# # used to chain operations:
# t1 >> t2

# # And the upstream dependency with the
# # bit shift operator:
# t2 << t1

# # Chaining multiple dependencies becomes
# # concise with the bit shift operator:
# t1 >> t2 >> t3

# # A list of tasks can also be set as
# # dependencies. These operations
# # all have the same effect:
# t1.set_downstream([t2, t3])
# t1 >> [t2, t3]
# [t2, t3] << t1
